-For this website I used a technique called a parallax scrolling and is used in 2d side scroll games aswell as many other websites. 

-It includes CSS and a little bit of javascript I also used photoshop to give each image an artistic filter to it. Its primary purpose as a website is 
for users to come and learn about popular nordic vikings of the 8th century and have a cool scroll parallax effects to go along with it.
